# CareConnect Notification Service

Receives domain events (currently via HTTP) and records notification delivery attempts across channels.

## Local Development

```bash
cd notification-service
npm install
PORT=3000 npm start
```

- `PORT` defaults to `3000`; override only if you need a different HTTP port.
- Persistence: lightweight JSON file (`data/notifications.json`). Override location with `DB_PATH`.
- Simulated dispatch logs output to stdout for observability.

## HTTP API
